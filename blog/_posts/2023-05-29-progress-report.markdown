XML support is progressing nicely! Thanks to the great work of [@evilpie](https://github.com/evilpie), these games have become playable in Ruffle:
- [*PaintWorld*](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/607069/format/flash?emulate=flash)
- [*Army of Ages*](https://www.gameflare.com/online-game/army-of-ages/)
- [*Tilt*](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/486700/format/flash?emulate=flash)
- [*Headless Zombie 2*](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/651073?emulate=flash)

[@Aaron1011](https://github.com/Aaron1011/)'s work on Stage3D continues! Many of the newer Fancy Pants games are now playable:
- *The Fancy Pants Adventures: World 4* series: [Part 1](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/750785), [Part 2](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/752737)
- [*The Cutie Pants Adventures*](https://www.kongregate.com/games/DrNeroCF/the-cutie-pants-adventures-world-1)

Note: Because Stage3D is graphically intensive, only the Ruffle desktop app can currently run these games well.

### ActionScript 2 support is improving too!
[@Toad06](https://github.com/Toad06/) has implemented some additional XML methods, making *Mission in Snowdriftland* playable in Ruffle! You can check it out on the [Flashpoint testing site](https://ooooooooo.ooo/static/?7d01dea2-d54f-f04a-bd84-49477152fabb) (forgive the goofy URL).

### The Ruffle desktop app finally has a user inteface!
Thanks to the efforts of [@mike](https://github.com/Herschel/) and [@Dinnerbone](https://github.com/Dinnerbone/), the desktop app now has a menu bar and context menu! You can also open SWF files by dragging them into the Ruffle window.

### Ruffle now has a built-in save manager!
Thanks to the work of [@danielhjacobs](https://github.com/danielhjacobs/), web builds of Ruffle allow you to back up and restore your progress for any game. Just right-click => Open Save Manager!

### We're looking for help localizing Ruffle to other languages!
If you'd like to help translate Ruffle into your language, please [join our new CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/ruffle).

### Ruffle finally supports copying and pasting text!
Thanks to the efforts of [myself](https://github.com/n0samu/) and [@Toad06](https://github.com/Toad06/), editable text boxes in Ruffle now support cutting, copying and pasting. You can also press Ctrl-A to select all. Check out the demo below, where I create, copy and paste a level code in *Super Mario Flash*!
