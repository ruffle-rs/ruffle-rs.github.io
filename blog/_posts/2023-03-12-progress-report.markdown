# Incredible progress in AVM2 (ActionScript 3) support!
- Our website now has a page listing exactly what ActionScript 3 APIs we have implemented, making it easy to follow our progress. It will be frequently updated! [https://ruffle.rs/avm2.html](https://ruffle.rs/avm2.html)
- XML support is rapidly improving! ActionScript 3 games tend to use a wide variety of XML methods. As Ruffle gains support for these methods, games are springing to life!
- Several problems that caused unresponsive buttons and menus have been fixed. Unclickable buttons in ActionScript 3 games are (mostly) a thing of the past!
- Other major refactors are in progress to improve Ruffle's compatibility with ActionScript 3 frameworks like Haxe.
- @Aaron1011 is working on **Stage3D support**! Thanks to his work, the gorgeous interstellar strategy game Solarmax 2 will soon be playable in Ruffle! Check out the video below.

# Last but not least, support for **mobile devices** is improving in a big way!
- **Text input boxes** are finally supported on mobile devices! Tapping on a text box within Flash content now brings up the soft keyboard, so you can type into it without using a bluetooth keyboard or other workarounds.
- The **context menu** finally works on iOS! It is activated by a long-press on the screen. To stop this behavior if needed, simply tap the "Hide this menu" option.
