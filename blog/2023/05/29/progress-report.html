ActionScript 2 support is improving too! @Toad06 has implemented some additional XML methods, making Mission in Snowdriftland playable in Ruffle! You can check it out on the Flashpoint testing site (forgive the goofy URL). The Ruffle desktop app finally has a user inteface! Thanks to the efforts of @mike and @Dinnerbone, the desktop app now has a menu bar and context menu! You can also open SWF files by dragging them into the Ruffle window. Ruffle now has a built-in save manager! Thanks to the work of @danielhjacobs, web builds of Ruffle allow you to back up and restore your progress for any game. Just right-click =&gt; Open Save Manager! We’re looking for help localizing Ruffle to other languages! If you’d like to help translate Ruffle into your language, please join our new CrowdIn project. Ruffle finally supports copying and pasting text! Thanks to the efforts of myself and @Toad06, editable text boxes in Ruffle now support cutting, copying and pasting. You can also press Ctrl-A to select all. Check out the demo below, where I create, copy and paste a level code in Super Mario Flash! We have more awesome things coming up! Tonight’s Ruffle build will feature some major desktop interface improvements from @Dinnerbone! @kmeisthax is working on FLV support! Soon Ruffle will support Flash content with external video files. You can follow his progress here. @uqers is working on mixed AVM support! This will resolve crashes in ActionScript 2 games encrypted with MochiCrypt, along with other games and applications that mix ActionScript 2 and 3. You can follow his progress here. @Michiel is working on a fix for unclickable buttons in many AS2 games, such as Electricman 2 and Super Soldier. You can follow his progress here." />
