        Arguably more important than contributing code is testing Ruffle out. Go
        install Ruffle and try out your favourite games and animations. Look for
        any difference from the official Flash Player, and report your findings
        to us.

        Is your favourite Flash-based site shutting down? Let them know they can
        add one JavaScript file and keep it running! Feeling nostalgic for some
        old Flash games? Go play some on Newgrounds with Ruffle installed, and
        tell your friends about it! Maybe you're a streamer and looking for some
        silly content? There's literally decades worth, now unlocked and
        accessible once more.

            Ruffle is an entirely open source project, maintained by volunteers
            like you who just want to help preserve a slice of history. We rely
            on contributions of any kind to keep this project going, and
            absolutely would not have come as far as we have without the amazing
            support of our community who came together to make Ruffle happen. If
            you'd like to join them, there are many ways to help make Ruffle
            better than ever!
